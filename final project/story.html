		The MRI Is A Snapshot<br>
		__________________________<br><br>
		200,000 American men, women and children will have open brain surgery this year. Each patient's MRI is used to both plan the surgery, and to keep track of the surgeons tools within the brain.
	</div>
	<div class = "story2">
		The Brain Is Animated<br>
		__________________________<br><br><br>
		The surgery begins by opening the cranium, which creates a change in pressure that changes the brain's position and shape.  It immediately begins to slowly deflate.

	<div class = "story3">
		Precision 3D Vision<br>
		__________________________<br><br>
		We track the exposed brain and use that data, along with a computer model of the brain that simulates the entire volume to animate a simulation of the patient's MRI, corrected for error.

		Advanced Scanners is a seed stage medical device company, formed in 2017 by a PhD optical physicist and a serial entrepreneur to solve this problem. 
		<br>
		In the future, robots won't replace humans.  They will enhance human capabilities.  This trend is taking place all around us. Simply put, machines and computers can perform some tasks so much faster, consistently, and accurately, than we can.
		<br>
	</div>
	<div class = "story5">
		To prevent a lifetime of catastrophic, but avoidable, disabilities for children with epilepsy, we are making a 3D machine vision system to make brain surgery more science, less art.
		<br>
		People and machines, working together.  Thatâ€™s what the future looks like, and we are the eyes of that movement.
